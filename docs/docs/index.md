# SekaiTachi Rules

To ensure that the score tracker remains accurate and that everyone has a good experience, SekaiTachi enforces the following rules.

---

## R1: You MUST NOT deliberately fake score submissions.

The punishment for this is an immediate, permanent IP ban.

Accidental mistakes in score submissions that result in invalid scores appearing on your profile are acceptable. However, if this happens repeatedly and consistently benefits you, you will be warned.

!!! warning
    Cheating on SekaiTachi is very easy. With basic programming knowledge, you could fake scores through JSON, or even more easily by submitting incorrect data through the Discord bot.

    There is no anti-cheat system for this, by design.

    As a result, this rule is enforced extremely strictly.

    You do not get a second chance. If you fake scores, you permanently lose access to the tracker.

## R2: You MUST NOT play on invalid input devices or game versions.

SekaiTachi has flexible standards for what counts as a “legitimate” setup. In general, this means:

- No automated scripts  
- No modded APKs (with limited exceptions)

This helps maintain a fair playing field.

Valid game versions are listed below.

### Project Sekai

| Game | Devices | Justification |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Project Sekai EN/JP | Any touchscreen device, played without third-party devices | Unless you require accessibility accommodations (e.g., a prosthetic hand), there is no need for automated assistance. Other regions are unsupported due to data limitations. |
| Ourstage | Any touchscreen device, without third-party devices or scripts | Ourstage can be modified, so only versions from the official source are allowed. |

!!! info
    Use common sense. Not every legitimate setup is listed here, and we will not whitelist every possible configuration.

    If you are unsure whether your setup is allowed, ask in the Discord.

    We cannot verify every version, so we rely on user honesty.

---

## R3: One account per person.

You may only have one account.

Multiple accounts are not allowed. We monitor IP addresses to enforce this and to keep the leaderboards fair.

---

## R4: Keep content appropriate.

Do not use inappropriate profile pictures, banners, usernames, or descriptions.

Many minors use this platform. Keep things respectful.

Similarly, keep session names and “About Me” sections appropriate.

In general: don’t be rude or offensive.

---

## R5: Use common sense.

These rules are not exhaustive.

Staff reserve the right to take action, including bans, at their discretion.

Attempting to exploit loopholes or technicalities is not permitted.

For example, while the rules do not explicitly forbid using flashing GIFs designed to trigger seizures, common sense makes it clear that this is unacceptable.
